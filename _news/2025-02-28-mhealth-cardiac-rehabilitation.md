## Review: Effectiveness of Home-Based Cardiac Rehabilitation via mHealth

We are excited to share our **recently published systematic review and meta-analysis**, which examines the effectiveness of **home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) interventions delivered via mobile health (mHealth) technologies**. This study was developed as part of an **international research collaboration**, leveraging expertise in **digital health, rehabilitation science, and information systems** from **University of Illinois at Chicago, HEC Montr√©al, and Otto-Friedrich-Universit√§t Bamberg**.

### Key Findings:
- mHealth-supported HBCR **significantly improves** functional capacity, as measured by **6-minute walk test (6MWT) and VO‚ÇÇ peak**, compared to usual care.
- No significant difference was observed between **mHealth HBCR and CBCR**, suggesting that **mHealth interventions could serve as viable alternatives for patients unable to attend in-person programs**.
- mHealth interventions, including smartphone applications, wearable devices, and remote monitoring, help overcome barriers related to **transportation, time constraints, and accessibility**.
- The quality of evidence varies, with some limitations due to small sample sizes and potential bias.

### Implications:
This study highlights the **potential of mHealth technologies** to bridge the gap in **remote cardiac rehabilitation delivery**, particularly for underserved populations. Future research should focus on improving the **clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence** to support wider adoption in clinical practice and health policy.
