## Rethinking Git Teaching â€“ A Novel Pedagogical Approach

We are excited to share our recently published article, _Rethinking How We Teach Git_, which introduces a pedagogically grounded and practically tested framework for teaching Git in information systems education. This work was developed collaboratively at Otto-Friedrich-UniversitÃ¤t Bamberg as part of our broader efforts to equip students with essential tools for digital collaboration, open-source contribution, and reproducible research.

### Key Findings:
- **New teaching sequence**: We challenge conventional Git pedagogy by starting with **branching**â€”the backbone of Gitâ€™s modelâ€”before moving to committing and collaboration. This reordering, based on cognitive and pedagogical theory, improves understanding and student confidence.
- **Cognitive and practical scaffolding**: By disentangling technical setup and isolating competence areas (branching, committing, collaborating), the approach allows students to progress through conceptually self-contained modules before tackling integration and transfer tasks.
- **Gamified and open-source learning**: Students practiced Git in realistic, hands-on environments such as the [Open-Source Collaboration Game](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13323591), reinforcing social learning and skill transfer in open project contexts.

### Implications:
Git is no longer a niche skillâ€”it underpins workflows in **software development, digital research methods, academic handbooks**, and **collaborative writing**. In our curriculum, Git training is an essential pillar:
- In the [Introduction to Digital Work](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/), students engage with Git for organizing Markdown-based content.
- In [The Open-Source Project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/), Git is used in Python development and collaborative review tools.
- We expect Git to become increasingly relevant for **qualitative research** and **literature review workflows** requiring structured versioning, transparency, and collaboration.
