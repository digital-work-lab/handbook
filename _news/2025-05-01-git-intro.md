## Rethinking Git Teaching â€“ A Novel Pedagogical Approach

We are excited to share our recently published article, _Rethinking How We Teach Git_, which introduces a pedagogically grounded and practically tested framework for teaching Git in information systems education. This work was developed collaboratively at Otto-Friedrich-UniversitÃ¤t Bamberg as part of our broader efforts to equip students with essential tools for digital collaboration, open-source contribution, and reproducible research.

### Key Findings:
- **New teaching sequence**: We challenge conventional Git pedagogy by starting with **branching**â€”the backbone of Gitâ€™s modelâ€”before moving to committing and collaboration. This reordering, based on cognitive and pedagogical theory, improves understanding and student confidence.
- **Cognitive and practical scaffolding**: By disentangling technical setup and isolating competence areas (branching, committing, collaborating), the approach allows students to progress through conceptually self-contained modules before tackling integration and transfer tasks.
- **Gamified and open-source learning**: Students practiced Git in realistic, hands-on environments such as the [Open-Source Collaboration Game](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13323591){: target="_blank"}, reinforcing social learning and skill transfer in open project contexts.

### Implications:
Git is no longer a niche skillâ€”it underpins workflows in **software development, research methods, academic handbooks**, and **collaborative writing**. In our curriculum, Git training is an essential pillar:

- In the [Introduction to Digital Work](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/digital-work-lecture/){: target="_blank"}, students engage with Git for organizing and managing Markdown-based content, learning its role in structuring and maintaining digital documents collaboratively.
- In [The Open-Source Project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/){: target="_blank"}, Git is used extensively in Python package development, open-source contribution, and collaborative tool-building, including testing, documentation, and issue tracking workflows.

We expect Git to become increasingly relevant for **qualitative research** and **literature review workflows**, where structured versioning, transparency, and reproducibility are essential:
- We develop the [CoLRev](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev){: target="_blank"} platform as a Git-based, open-synthesis environment for collaborative and reproducible literature reviews, enabling versioned evidence bases, traceable inclusion decisions, and automation-supported synthesis.
- Our [Digital Work Lab Handbook](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/){: target="_blank"} is itself developed as a Git-based participatory initiative, demonstrating how academic teams can co-create, maintain, and evolve living documentation for research, teaching, and collaboration.

These examples illustrate how Git is transforming not only code-based work, but also broader practices of digital scholarship, pedagogy, and academic knowledge production.
