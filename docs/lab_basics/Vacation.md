###  4.4 Handover Procedures

The Supervisor is responsible for the handover procedures

- **Communication and briefing:** Prior to the researcher's holiday, they should schedule a meeting with the team members to discuss the ongoing projects, tasks, and any pending deadlines. They should communicate any critical information, potential challenges, and specific instructions for handling various scenarios.

- **Documenting project details:** The researcher should ensure that all project-related information is documented and organized in a central location. The team members should have access to this documentation. Additionally, the researcher should clearly outline the responsibilities and roles of each team member during the handover period.

## 5. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

### 5.2 Emergency Situations
