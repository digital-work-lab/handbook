###  4.4 Handover Procedures

The Supervisor is responsible for the handover procedures

- **Communication and briefing:** Prior to the researcher's holiday, they should schedule a meeting with the team members to discuss the ongoing projects, tasks, and any pending deadlines. They should communicate any critical information, potential challenges, and specific instructions for handling various scenarios.

- **Documenting project details:** The researcher should ensure that all project-related information is documented and organized in a central location. The team members should have access to this documentation. Additionally, the researcher should clearly outline the responsibilities and roles of each team member during the handover period.

## 5. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

### 5.1 Extended Leaves of Absence
- **Student Assistants** may, upon application, be released from the obligation of proper study (leave of absence). This must be approved by the management of the digital-work lab.

  The reasons for the leave of absence must be stated in writing in the application and must be supported by appropriate evidence.

  The reason for the leave of absence must cover at least six weeks of the lecture period.

- No extension of leave is possible for **reseachers/supervisors**.


### 5.2 Emergency Situations

- During emergency situations when an important team member is on vacation, it is crucial to have a plan in place. The first step is to identify a designated **backup or point of contact** who can assume the responsibilities and decision-making authority of the absent team member.
- This backup should be well-informed about the ongoing projects, possess the necessary expertise, and be able to make critical decisions in the absence of the vacationing team member.

### 5.3 Changes in Vacation Plans

When changes need to be made to the vacation plan, **open and transparent communication is key**.
The team member should promptly notify their supervisor/Researcher about the change, providing a clear explanation and any necessary documentation, and work collaboratively to adjust the plan.

Temporary staffing and backfilling can work out effectively by carefully assessing the required skills, providing clear instructions, **ensuring open communication, and strategically selecting temporary staff** to fill the vacant positions and maintain productivity within the team.
