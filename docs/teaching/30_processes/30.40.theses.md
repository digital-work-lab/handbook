# 30.40 Theses

The thesis is one of the key accomplishments when studying at a University. To support you throughout the process, we provide a clear overview of the steps, transparent evaluation criteria, as well as a developmental approach.
An overview of the process is available [here](30.40.theses_process.html) and information on individual theses is recorded internally ([35 Theses](../35_theses.html)).

A [changelog](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/commits/main/docs/teaching/30_processes/30.40.theses.md) is available for this document.

## 1. First contact (Student, thesis advisor)

Students can select open topics available on our [website](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/digital-work/studium/abschlussarbeiten/) or suggest topics related to our research areas.
To start the process, reach out via e-mail and schedule a meeting to discuss topic and next steps:

[Schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min){: .btn .btn-green }

To prepare the next step, it is recommended to start developing an exposé.

## 2. Apply for admission (Student, thesis advisor, examination office)

Students send the **application for admission** to the thesis to the *examination office* via their Stud e-mail address. You can use [this e-mail template](30.40.thesis_admission_mail.html).

The examination office **verifies** the admission requirements.

- If admission requirements are met, the topic confirmation is created with text fields so that the topic of the thesis and the date of topic issue can be entered.
- If the admission requirements are not met, the student is notified that the application has been rejected.

The examination office may ask the student to request an approval by the examination committee (Prüfungsausschuss) to write a thesis in the area of *Digital Work*. This is the case when older regulations (Studien- und Fachprüfungsordnung) apply (i.e., when master studies were started before 2018).

Students **receive the topic confirmation** as a (protected) Word document (.docx) by e-mail together with processing/submission instructions as well as inspection statement. The next step is to make an appointment with the thesis advisor to determine the topic and sign the topic confirmation. At the same time, the secretary receives this message in CC for information and enters the data into the [overview](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-teaching/35_theses/000_overview&fileid=608).

Student and thesis advisor schedule a meeting to determine the topic and **sign the topic confirmation**:

- 1 original with signature of the professor and the student for the student.
- 1 original with signature of the professor and the student for archiving at the chair (added to the [19-archive](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/files?dir=/10-lab/19_archive&fileid=62)).

If the appointment is online, you can print and sign the confirmation, and send it to our [postal address](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/digital-work/team/prof-dr-gerit-wagner/).

The copy for the examination office is sent by the chair as a Word document (.docx) by e-mail to the examination office. The topic and the day of topic issue are entered into FlexNow by the examination office.

Upon completing the topic confirmation, the **thesis advisor moves the documents** to [35 - theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124). Details are updated in [35.000 - overview](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-teaching/35_theses/000_overview&fileid=608).

## 3. Thesis writing and feedback sessions (Student, thesis advisor)

The student completes the exposé before writing the thesis.
A thesis must be written in English.
The following resources are relevant:

- The [evaluation criteria](30.40.theses_criteria.html)
- The [schedule](30.40.theses_schedule.html)
- The thesis template for [markdown](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/thesis-template) or [word](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/main/assets/docs/thesis_template.docx)
- The [literature review section](../../research/20_processes/20.10.literature-review.html)
- The [analysis templates section](../../research/20_processes/20.21.analysis-templates.html)
- The [writing section](../../research/20_processes/20.29.writing.html) (in particular correct citation practices)

We offer regular feedback sessions (every one to two weeks) to discuss open questions and the next steps. Feedback sessions can be in person or online:

[Schedule feedback session](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min){: .btn .btn-green }

Bachelor's theses are usually due in 4 months, Master's theses in 6 months. The official requirements can be found in the regulations linked below.
It is not necessary to submit the thesis in the semester in which it was started (unless you would take longer than the maximum duration of study).

For students of Applied Informatics, Software Systems Science, and Computing in the Humanities a practical part is required for Bachelor's and Master's theses.

Documents and notes are stored in [35 - theses](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/30-teaching/35_theses&fileid=124).

## 4. Submission of the thesis (Student)

Two copies in hard bound form and one digital version each are to be submitted to the examination office.

- During opening hours Mon-Fri 10.00 - 12.00: Hand in the thesis at the examination office (Kapuzinerstr. 25)
- Outside of opening hours: Drop the thesis in the mailbox of the University Administration (Kapuzinerstr. 16)
- Dispatch by mail (the date of the postmark counts) Otto-Friedrich-University, Examination Office - 96045 Bamberg

## 5. Thesis presentation (Student)

- The student must present at her/his master thesis ...
- The thesis advisor and professor set a date for the presentation
- A second examiner is required (check whether this is adequate)
- The grading template is available here (**TODO**)
- Protocols should be archived (digitally / paper versions?)

## 6. Grading (Thesis advisor)

The thesis advisor (professor) grades the thesis based on the [template](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/thesis_review) and the predefined [criteria](30.40.theses_criteria.html).

- A thesis is checked for plagiarism and generative AI based on [Turnitin](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/its/turnitin) and [gptzero](https://gptzero.me). In case plagiarism is detected, the [Plagiarism Process](30.52.plagiarism.html) is started.
- If programming is required as part of the thesis, this should be confirmed in the review.
- For master theses, the weight of the written part is 67% and the weight of the presentation is 33% (based on [Master WI MHB](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/abt-studium/Modulhandbuecher/WIAI/WI/Master/MHB_MA_WI_2018.pdf)). **Grades for the thesis and the colloquium must be stated separately**.
- The deadline is given by the examination office. Our goal is to grade theses within two weeks (the official deadline allows up to 4 months). 
- The review and grade are sent to the examination office.
- The PDF is archived at [14.04](https://nc-2272638881871040784.nextcloud-ionos.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/10-lab/14_grades/04_theses&fileid=73). Materials in 35.XXX should be consolidated.
- The hardback copy of the thesis, which remains at the chair, is stored in the archive room WE5/05.058.
- Grades are entered by the examination office. Students can check the grade via FlexNow.

## 7. Feedback session (Thesis advisor, student)

We provide feedback on the thesis and explain the grading. A short summary is stored on our [feedback page](30.40.theses_feedback.html) if students agree.
