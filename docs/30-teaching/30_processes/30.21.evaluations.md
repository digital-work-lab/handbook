# 30.21 Evaluations

## Purpose

Evaluate teaching activities **at the end of each semester**.

{: .highlight }
> **Trigger**
> 
> Evaluations can be ordered by **early December / early July**. We receive an e-mail reminder.

## Process

- Evaluations can be ordered via EvaSys, which requires a **minimum of 5 students** to complete the evaluation. Otherwise, anonymity is not given, and results will not be made available.
- For small courses, it is possible to use other tools or modes of evaluation.
- It is possible and recommended to adapt (shorten) the survey.
- Evaluation results and potential improvements should be discussed with students (last week of teaching).
- Students should be reminded in the session and via VC.
- Add to the list of prior reports below.
- The evaluation results are stored in 19.XXXXXX (Nextcloud) and published in the handbook (linked in the table below).
- Evaluation results should be analyzed to improve teaching activities. Improvements are documented in the [30.22 Improvements](30.22.improvements.html) section.
- Evaluation results are shared (e.g., via e-mail or link in VC) and discussed with students.

## Example for the invitation to the evaluation
