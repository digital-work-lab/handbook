## Responsibility

- Professor

## Process

- Notification is sent out by the Dean's office (mid-July / mid-January)
- The form is available online ([Erklärung zur Erfüllung der Lehrverpflichtung](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/abt-personal/formulare-infos-und-merkblaetter/){: target="_blank"} / Lehrdeputat)
- Required to teach 7 SWS (in the first three years: 5 SWS).
- When reporting more (or less), a reason must be provided (e.g., "Sicherstellung des Lehrangebots").

Theses

- Check for [theses completed this semester](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/theses-confidential){: target="_blank"}.

- Theses can be reported in the semester of admission or grading.
- If the LUFV deadline has already passed, a thesis can also be reported in the following semester.
- Theses that have required considerable effort for supervision but were not completed may also be reported.
- SWS: 0.15 for Bachelor's theses, and 0.45 for Master's theses (Bachelorarbeit / Diplom- bzw. Masterarbeit in Ingenieurswissenschaften).
- A maximum of 2 SWS for theses can be reported per semester.
