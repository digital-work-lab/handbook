# 30.01 Teaching concept

## "Preparing for a digital world of work"

Our focus is on equipping students with the **skills and knowledge necessary for the digital future of work**.
We prioritize skills that are relevant across a variety of professional settings, particularly those related to digital work practices, organizing distributed teams, and synthesizing knowledge.
We place a strong emphasis on complex skill development and fostering a mindset of continuous learning.
The content we cover goes beyond what is typically found in information systems textbooks, integrating topics from the fields of organizational psychology and behavior, insights from practitioners, open-source software engineering, and moral philosophy to provide a holistic understanding of modern work environments.

We aim to make a **real-world impact** with our students' work. Our teaching approach is centered around giving students the opportunity to create and publish products, papers, or other outcomes that have tangible relevance.
We empower students to contribute to real-world, publicly accessible projects, such as Python packages.
This hands-on experience not only enhances their technical skills but also instills a sense of accomplishment and relevance.
These projects provide students with concrete examples of their work that they can showcase on their CVs, demonstrating their practical contributions and teamwork skills to potential employers.

## Pedagogical Approach and Teaching Methods

We convey a sense of **genuine excitement** in everything we teach.
Our passion for the subject matter plays a pivotal role in motivating students to challenge themselves and grow.
To foster this engagement, we employ a variety of teaching formats that encourage exploration, collaboration, and competition.
We focus on guiding students through the learning process by asking insightful questions and offering support, all while preserving the inherent complexity of the material.
This ensures that students develop resilience and sharpen their problem-solving abilities.
In addition, we "dogfood" the  work practices, tools and theory we cover in our sessions by implementing strategies such as Getting-Things-Done, organizing our work through a public handbook, and using cutting-edge knowledge management systems.
Additionally, we integrate our research into our teaching, bringing real-world examples to the classroom and enriching the learning experience.

**Continuous improvement** is at the core of our teaching philosophy.
We adopt an iterative process where feedback from students and peer-reviewed teaching materials drive the evolution of our course content.
By regularly updating the material, we ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest trends and academic developments.
We constantly challenge ourselves to teach new topics, such as the new lecture *Introduction to Digital Work*, and to teach existing topics more effectively, for instance through our pedagogical recommendations for teaching Git.
We develop teaching materials in openly accessible repositories and under open content licenses.
Each repository, along with learning resources, such as slides and notebooks, provides students the opportunity to suggest changes and offer feedback through the open-source workflows of GitHub.
This collaborative approach fosters an open and fully digital learning environment where students can actively contribute, and adapt the course content in real time.

**Diversity, equity, and inclusion** are central to the learning environments we create.
We create inclusive environments where every student feels empowered to contribute and is recognized for their value.
By fostering a non-judgmental learning atmosphere, we encourage students to take risks, make mistakes, and ask questions—important components of innovation and problem-solving.
Our goal is to create a space where students are not afraid to experiment and explore new ideas, contributing to a more dynamic and diverse educational experience that mirrors the inclusive and collaborative environments they will encounter in their future careers.

### Focal area 1: The digital transformation of work

The digital transformation of work is a key area that focuses on understanding how technological advancements have reshaped the nature of work.
It covers both the historical context of digitalization and the practical skills needed to thrive in today’s digital workplaces.
This area emphasizes the tools and strategies necessary for organizing digital work, including the ability to select and adapt tools for specific situations.
As work environments continue to evolve, driven by trends such as remote work, digital nomadism, and the rise of crowd-sourced platforms, students are introduced to state-of-the-art digital work practices.
They also acquire technical skills, such as proficiency in Git, which are critical for managing distributed development and version control in collaborative settings.
Beyond technical competencies, this area fosters the development of collaboration skills, with students participating in individual, team-based, and crowd-sourced projects to simulate real-world work scenarios.
By engaging in these activities, students gain a deeper understanding of how digital tools enable flexible, personalized work environments while also exploring the ethical and societal implications of these shifts.
The most prominent example of this focal area is the lecture [Introduction to Digital Work](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/digital-work-lecture/){: target="_blank"}, where these concepts are explored in depth and applied through hands-on learning and practical projects.

### Focal area 2: Open-source development in teams

Open-source development serves as a prime example of modern digital work and is central to this area of study.
<!-- , as noted by Baiyere, Schneider and Klein (2023), -->
It emphasizes the collaborative, transparent, and community-driven nature of software development in the digital era.
In the [Open-Source Project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/){: target="_blank"}, we teach students the fundamentals of distributed software development using Git, providing them with the tools necessary to manage and organize projects in a decentralized manner.
Students engage in practical exercises focused on project organization, collaborative development, and maintaining code quality.
These exercises ensure that students not only learn the technical aspects but also experience the real-world challenges and advantages of working in distributed development environments.
Each student or group contributes to a public-facing Python package.
Regular project updates, hacking sessions, and code reviews are integral to this area, providing iterative feedback and opportunities for continuous improvement.
Through these hands-on experiences, students gain a comprehensive understanding of open-source development and the skills needed to work in collaborative, distributed software projects.

### Focal area 3: Knowledge synthesis

The knowledge synthesis area focuses on equipping students with the skills to synthesize academic and non-academic knowledge and conduct rigorous literature reviews.
Central to this is the [Literature Review Seminar](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/literature-review-seminar/){: target="_blank"}, which covers the different types and goals of reviews, the review process, the qualities of review papers, and tools supporting the conduct of literature reviews.
We encourage students to apply these review methods specifically to research on digital work, enabling them to explore and critically analyze current trends in digital transformation and its broader impact on workplaces.
Through this process, students not only gain a deep understanding of knowledge synthesis but also develop the ability to identify and address key research gaps and contribute to the academic discourse.

### **Concluding remarks on theses and mentoring**

Our approach to [theses](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/theses/){: target="_blank"} and mentoring focuses on providing personalized guidance while fostering independence and critical thinking.
We support students in choosing innovative research topics that have real-world relevance and align with academic standards, offering regular feedback to help them stay on track.
We encourage students to contribute to ongoing research projects, co-author papers, and engage with the academic community.
By doing so, we create a dynamic learning environment where students not only complete their theses but also gain valuable experience.
Our goal is to empower students to produce work that makes a tangible impact on the field of digital work.
