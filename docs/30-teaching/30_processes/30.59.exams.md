## Grading and entering grades in FlexNow

{: .important }
The examination documents (protocols, attendance lists, etc.) must be sent back to the examination office immediately. Missed exams and cases of cheating must be entered in FlexNow immediately.

Before grading (day of the exam)

- Cases of cheating (Unterschleif): immediately enter it into FlexNow and send the exam to the examination office (do not grade it)
- Cases of missed exams (Versäumnisklausuren): immediately enter it into FlexNow, archive the exams for 1 year in the filing cabinet.
- Send the exam sheets, protocols (Anwesenheitslisten), and two empty exams to the examination office immediately after the exams are completed.
- Empty exams (Versäumnis-Klausur): archive for one semester.

Grading

- Create reminder for the deadline: approx. 15. September (summer term), ??? (winter term). Grade early because colleagues may be on vacation before the deadline (not available to review failed exams).
- Add bonus points if any and **if exam is passed**. Otherwise, note the bonus points and add a note "kann nicht angerechnet werden".
- Do not dispose of empty exams
- Use the [grading scripts](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/grading){: target="_blank"} to assign grades and prepare FlexNow import
- Have failed exams reviewed by a second professor
- Grades are entered in [FlexNow](30.15.flexnow.html#entering-grades). Certificates can be issued if exams are not (yer) available in FlexNow ([script](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/scheine){: target="_blank"})).
