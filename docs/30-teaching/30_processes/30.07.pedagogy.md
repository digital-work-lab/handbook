## Main Pedagogical Framework

Curriculum development according to Thomas et al. (2022):

- Step 1 Problem Identification and General Needs Assessment 
- Step 2 Needs Assessment for Targeted Learners 
- Step 3 Goals and Objectives
- Step 4 Educational Strategies 
- Step 5 Implementation
- Step 6 Evaluation and Feedback

## Evidence-based practice

Hattie (2009) aggregates evidence from over 800 meta-analyses on learning and teaching, offering a substantive knowledge base to guide our teaching efforts.

## Syllabus Design

- Basic information (Instructor, contact and availability, dates, degree, prerequisites, format online/in person, state whether/when attendance is mandatory)
- Course description with teaching philosophy (link to pedagogical foundations, include safety and inclusiveness statement)
- Goal and learning objectives
- Course outline: contents in a timeline
- Assessment (Grading) and student responsibilities (possibly a "how to succeed" section)
- Materials (access) and resources

## Rules and Classroom Management

Rules affect student behavior and teaching conditions. Strict rules can have several advantages, such as (1) setting clear expectations, (2) reducing free-riding, or (3) allowing instructors to be more supportive instead of disciplining students. For example:

- In the open-source project, the rule is that students only participate if they contribute actual code to the group project. Students know that they are expected to contribute code before a predefined deadline, and that the contributions will be checked. Given that students are not assigned to a group and do not receive a grade without contributing code, free-riding (having the others work without putting in much effort) is limited. In addition, students may take proactive ownership for their work, and ask instructors and teaching assistants for help. This allows us to play a more supportive role, instead of trying to discipline students towards the end of the project.

<!-- it is easier to control risks proactively instead of trying to fix them reactively -->

## General student feedback

- Create opportunities for students to meet and form study groups
- Consider student workload
