# Pandoc Word Template

Pandoc supports Word templates (aka **reference-doc**) for efficient formatting. (see [docs](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) --reference-doc=FILE|URL, DOCX).

>[!Note]
> Pandoc reference documents do not support every detailed formatting step(such as tables).
> And they don't have to! We simply reserve some time to format the final document (once) and work in Git/Markdown.

We store templates for IS journals in the [templates](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/templates) repository.
