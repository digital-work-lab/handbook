# PowerPoint

## Formatting

- Use alignment (e.g., `ctrl`+`d`+`h`+`l` for left alignment)
- Adapt size of the slide to the figure (`ctrl`+`h`+`รถ`)

## Export when embedding figures in papers

- To have text embedded (searchable), use PDF exports (when figures are included in Markdown/Latex) or EMF (when figures are included in Word)
