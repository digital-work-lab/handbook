**[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){: target="_blank"}** is our preferred open-data format for the documentation (website), for writing papers and theses, managing knowledge, and creating slides. It is platform-independent, integrates well with git, and can easily be converted to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, DOCX) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/){: target="_blank"}.
