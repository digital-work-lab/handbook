# 10.04 Standard operating principles

We rely on standard operating principles to make high-quality contributions to research, teaching, and practice.
These principles summarize effective methods for staying focused on priorities, organizing projects efficiently, and coordinating efforts with ease.
While none of these principles are strictly mandatory, we encourage team members to try them, adapt them to their specific needs, and actively contribute to refining this overview.
This collaborative approach ensures continuous improvement and alignment with our goals.

## Work individually

### Focus

Our most important resource is focused work. Everyone may have a slightly different recipe on how to "get into the zone".
The following may be helpful to experiment:

- Blocking time slots for focused work (e.g., in the morning), and switching off e-mail and phones.
- Using distraction blockers like [Freedom](https://freedom.to/){: target="_blank"} or [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/){: target="_blank"}
- Working with techniques like Getting-Things-Done (GTD), bullet-journaling, daily priority lists, or Pomodoro
- Taking time to recharge every day, work out, take vacations

### Getting-Things-Done (GTD)

{: .highlight }
Work-in-progress

### Tools and processes

{: .highlight }
Work-in-progress

- Using the keyboard instead of the mouse
- Consistent file naming, optimized for keyboard access (e.g., `Future_of_Work.md` instead of `IDW_SoSe2024_Future_of_Work.md`)

<!-- e.g., OS/Codespace VM -->

### Sharing with deep links

A **deep link** is a URL that points directly to specific content within a page, rather than to the general page or document itself.
This allows users to access the exact information or context they need without having to navigate or search within the broader resource.

Examples of deep links:

- **Specific element in our handbook**:  
  `https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/20-research/20_processes/20.32.revision.html#expected-outcome`
- **Selected slide in our project**:  
  `https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/output/05-best_practice.html#technical-setup`
- **A comment in an issue discussion**:  
  `https://github.com/digital-work-lab/digital-work-lecture/issues/8#issuecomment-2199793685`
- **TODO**: Calendar, People, Agenda

How to create a deep link:

- Click on the anchor and copy the URL:

![deep-link example](../../../assets/images/deep-link-handbook.gif)

- In slides, add the title after the `#`:

![deep-link example](../../../assets/images/deep-link-slides.gif)

<details>
  <summary>Why Use Deep Links</summary>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Precision and Clarity</strong>: 
        Deep links provide targeted access to relevant content, which reduces ambiguity and ensures recipients understand the exact context being referenced.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Improved Collaboration</strong>: 
        Sharing specific parts of documents or discussions encourages grounded and focused discussions, avoiding the inefficiency of reading or interpreting an entire document.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Workflows</strong>: 
        Deep links support modern collaborative practices by making resources easy to share, revisit, and update over time without additional explanation or redundant actions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Discoverability</strong>: 
        They create a networked "knowledge graph," allowing users to explore related information seamlessly through interconnected resources.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Time and Effort Savings</strong>: 
        By bypassing the need to search within a page, deep links save time for all collaborators.
    </li>
  </ol>

### Sharing contents and research results

- Agree on short names for research projects (e.g., BibDedupe, GitIntro). Short names should be related to the topic, not the target journal (avoid referring to "the MISQ paper")
- State dates  using the `YYYY-MM-DD` format to avoid ambiguity (use standard terminology and formats)
- To facilitate sharing, ensure that projects, contents, and processes are **linkable** and **editable** (e.g., in a thesis repository on GitHub, a link to the meeting notes can be shared, and thesis advisors can directly suggest modifications)
- Questions related to our processes etc. should be answered by sharing a link instead of answering the same question multiple times (e.g., [here](10.07.markdown.html#slides) are our guidelines for creating markdown slides) 
- Before the publication of results, research data (including code, interview data and manuscripts) should be kept private.
- Coordinate with your team on whether and when a shared repository will be available to the public and set a clear time frame to avoid misunderstandings.

### Agendas

To facilitate collaboration, we work with agenda repositories.
An agenda repository is a shared GitHub repository with a README.md file to keep track of meeting notes, TODOs, and items to discuss. It is one place to keep track of information that can be linked and edited by all participants.

Example repository: `https://github.com/digital-work-lab/agenda-adam-eva`

```
