# 10.99 Transition

## Handbook pages

- [ ] Consolidate [github workflows](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/.github/workflows).

The new handbook is [here](https://fs-ise.github.io/handbook/).

Pages that require an update for the transition:

{% assign pages_to_update = site.pages
  | where_exp: "p", "p.transition_status == 'toupdate' or p.transition_status == 'updated'"
  | sort: "title" %}

| Status | Page | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
{% for p in pages_to_update %}| {% if p.transition_status == "updated" %}✅{% else %}📝{% endif %} | [{{ p.title }}]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ p.url }}) | {{ p.transition_comment | default: "—" }}|
{% endfor %}


**Selecting pages that require changes**

To select pages, the `transition_status` and `transition_comment` fields must be added to the yaml header as follows:

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: 10.06 Resources
parent: 10 Lab Processes
grand_parent: Lab Management
nav_order: 7
transition_status: "toupdate"
transition_comment: "Update keys, lab access, printing/scanning, design, archive"
---

# 10.06 Resources

contents ....
```

Once the transition is implemented, the `transition_status` can be changed to `updated`.
