# 10.22 Meetings

If you would like to schedule an appointment with Prof. Wagner, please feel free to send a meeting invitation directly via Outlook. Prof. Wagner can then **accept,** **decline,** or **propose** a new time.{: .text-center}
➡️ This streamlines the scheduling process and avoids the need for prior email coordination.
