# 10.20 Agendas

TODO:

- move contents from 10.04 (add links in 10.04)
- link in 03 Responsibilities
- integrate in onboarding process/issue

<h2>Agendas</h2>

<p>To facilitate planning and collaboration, we work with agenda repositories. An agenda repository is a shared GitHub repository with a README.md file to keep track of meeting notes, TODOs, and items to discuss. It is one place to keep track of information that can be linked and edited by all participants.</p>

<p>Example repository: <a href="https://github.com/digital-work-lab/agenda-adam-eva">https://github.com/digital-work-lab/agenda-adam-eva</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/rayana/plan/">example: rayana</a></p>
