# 10.20 Agendas

TODO:

- integrate in onboarding process/issue
- Vacation notes
- Waiting-for items
- Upcoming items
- TBD: info on who edit what/when (GitHub blame - with illustration)
- Links / section to regular tasks (e.g., Teaching/Course administration)
- The agenda repository could be an obsidian vault

To facilitate planning and collaboration, we work with agenda repositories.
An agenda repository is a shared GitHub repository with a README.md file to keep track of meeting notes, TODOs, and items to discuss.
It is one place to keep track of information that can be linked and edited by all participants.
