## 2. Documentation - Vacation Balances Tracking:

- The remaining vacation days for **non-scientific staff** are stated in **[BayZeit](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/intranet/arbeitsplatz/zeiterfassung/){: target="_blank"}** (Urlaubsbogen für aktuelles Jahr)

## 3. Communication - Notification to Colleagues:

- **Notify your immediate colleagues personally and state vacation/absence days in your outlook calendar.** 
- **Inform your students (if applicable):** If you're a teacher, notify your students about your absence. Depending on their age and the nature of your classes, you can either inform them verbally or send a written communication. Include the dates of your vacation and any instructions or assignments they need to complete in your absence.
- **Set up an out-of-office message:** Configure an out-of-office email auto-responder, clearly stating the dates of your vacation and providing an alternative point of contact for urgent matters.

## 4. Handover Procedures

- **Communication and briefing:** Prior to the researcher's holiday, they should schedule a meeting with the team members to discuss the ongoing projects, tasks, and any pending deadlines. They should communicate any critical information, potential challenges, and specific instructions for handling various scenarios.
- **Documenting project details:** The researcher should ensure that all project-related information is documented and organized in a central location. The team members should have access to this documentation. Additionally, the researcher should clearly outline the responsibilities and roles of each team member during the handover period.

## 5. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

**Emergency Situations**

- During emergency situations when an important team member is on vacation, it is crucial to have a plan in place. The first step is to identify a designated **backup or point of contact** who can assume the responsibilities and decision-making authority of the absent team member.
- This backup should be well-informed about the ongoing projects, possess the necessary expertise, and be able to make critical decisions in the absence of the vacationing team member.

**Changes in Vacation Plans**

- When changes need to be made to the vacation plan, **open and transparent communication is the key**.
The team member should promptly notify their supervisor about the change, providing a clear explanation and any necessary documentation.

## 6. FAQs and Additional Resources

**How far in advance should vacation requests be submitted?**

* Vacation requests should be submitted at least two weeks in advance, to allow for proper planning and coordination.

**What is the policy for carrying over unused vacation days to the next year?**

* It is recommended to take all vacation days in the same year. You may be required to take your vacations before a certain date in the following year (other regulations may apply).
