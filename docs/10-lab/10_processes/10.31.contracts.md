# 10.31 Contracts

## Processes

When sending documents to HR, clearly indicate who should receive the confirmation documents and contracts.

- [PhD students](10.31.contracts_phd.html) (wissenschaftliches Personal)
- [Student assistants](10.31.contracts_sa.html)
- [Staff](10.31.contracts_staff.html)
- [External lecturers](10.31.contracts_ext_lect.html)

## Subsequent steps

- Contracts are stored in [11 HR](../11_hr.html).
- After creating an initial contract: order workstation etc. (10.52).
- For student assistants, we can order a used laptop (if needed).
