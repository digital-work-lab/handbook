# 20.21 Analysis templates
{: .no_toc }

This page summarizes standards for data analysis, including conventions related to the repository, the directory structure, and the data.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

{:toc}

## Repository

- Data should be versioned with Git. Repositories can be hosted and shared on GitHub.
- Visibility may initially be set to private. It is essential **not to publish confidential or copyright protected data** (this may include primary data from surveys, or PDF documents with copyrights owned by publishers)
- Once published, the team decides to switch to public visibility.
- Appropriate linters should be activated.
- See [repo-example](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/repo_example){: target="_blank"}, or [deep-cenic](https://github.com/julianprester/deep-cenic){: target="_blank"} example.

```

## Data

- Tabular datasets should follow a [tidy data structure](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html){: target="_blank"}.
- Preferred file formats include text files like md, txt, csv, py, ipynb, r.
- Binary formats, such as docx, pptx, or xlsx should be avoided.
- Resources on [research data management](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/ub/forschen-und-publizieren/forschungsdatenmanagement/){: target="_blank"} may be helpful.

## Docker

TODO : summarize the use of Docker containers [see analysis directory](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/repo_example){: target="_blank"}

- Organizing principles

Data checklist:
- [ ] have all raw data been imported?
- [ ] have all raw data been checked (for duplicates, import errors, ...)?
- [ ] create a description/coding_scheme.md describing how the data was collected.
  - When was it collected?
  - By whom was it collected?
  - Which processing steps have been implemented?
  - Save relevant scripts in 1-raw-data.
- [ ] are import procedures deterministic (e.g., creation of artificial identifiers)? This is essential when the data is updated
- [ ] is the csv-format consistent (quotenonnumeric)?
  - when opening and editing csv-files with Calc (LibreOffice), use "Quoted field as text" (Other options) (Make sure this is a default!)
- [ ] if the dataset is too big to be included in the git repository: create a symlink and describe where the data is stored
