# 20.34 Dissemination

The following can be used as a template to create a dissemination plan (replacing the contents in each section), noting who is responsible for specific action items (with deadlines):

## 1. Purpose and Objectives

- Define the purpose of your dissemination: 

  - To raise awareness, change policy, inform practices, or engage stakeholders.
  - **Objective Example**: To increase awareness about our research findings among healthcare providers and policymakers.

## 2. Key Research Findings

- Identify the specific findings or products that are ready for dissemination:

  - **Example**: A new decision support tool for healthcare providers.
  
- Highlight what makes these findings important or novel:

  - Are the results groundbreaking, contradicting previous evidence, or addressing an urgent need?

## 3. Target Audience

- Define your primary and secondary audiences:

  - **Primary**: Policy-makers, healthcare providers, researchers.
  - **Secondary**: General public, patients, stakeholders in healthcare.

- Tailor your message to meet the needs of each group. For example, use simplified messages for the general public, while more technical language may be appropriate for professionals.

## 4. Key Messages

- **Clarity**: Ensure messages are simple and accessible to your audience.
- **Actionability**: Communicate the actions the audience can take after engaging with your research.
- **Relevance**: Tailor messages to make them relevant and engaging to the audience.

- Consider using agencies / upworkers to create illustrations or short videos

## 5. Dissemination Methods and Channels

- Select appropriate methods based on your audience:

  - **Traditional Channels**: Journal articles, conference presentations, newsletters.
  - **Digital and Interactive Channels**: Social media, webinars, podcasts, blogs, infographics.
  
- Use a mix of platforms to enhance reach (e.g., social media for quick engagement, detailed reports for in-depth information).

## 6. Timing and Schedule

- Plan dissemination activities based on project milestones:

  - Early stages: Focus on raising awareness.
  - Completion: Highlight key findings and impacts.
  - External factors like conferences or national events may influence timing.

## 7. Partners and Stakeholders

- Identify and engage key dissemination partners, such as influential opinion leaders, relevant organizations, or networks to help amplify your message.
- Leverage partnerships with professional groups, accreditation bodies, and media.

## 8. Evaluation and Feedback

- Establish measurable indicators to assess the effectiveness of your dissemination activities (e.g., number of downloads, citations, feedback from stakeholders).
- Regularly collect and integrate feedback to improve future dissemination efforts.

## 9. Risks and Sensitivities

- Consider intellectual property concerns, political climates, or cultural factors that could influence the reception of your research.

## 10. Budget and Resources

- Outline the resources required for dissemination, including any funding for communication materials or event participation.
